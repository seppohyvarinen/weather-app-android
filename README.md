# weather-app-android

My name is Seppo Hyv√§rinen and this is my mobile weather app.

Idea is a basic weather application that uses the users location
in providing weather data for that specific location.
User can also search for weather data all over the world.
Also the app shows the user a 5 day forecast.

App is written using Kotlin and it's target devices are Androids.

App uses openweathermap API for fetching the weather information.
